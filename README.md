# CNN-with-TensorFlow
In this repository, I have created a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow. Multiple steps are followed. First, CCN is created after splitting data into train and test and followed by adding a dense layer, training, and evaluating the model. Though it was a small dataset to build a CNN model, data is augmented with Image Data Generator. The combination of the above techniques and a  pre-trained model and fine-tuning is used to classify images of dogs and cats using a small dataset. The convolutional base for our model is the MobileNet V2 that is developed by Google.
